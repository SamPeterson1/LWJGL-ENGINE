# About

This project is quite a mess, with it being my first large-scale project and my first attempt at using OpenGL.
What shows on the screen when runnning the program is essentially a bunch of tests that I had written many years ago,
and there is nothing at all polished about this project. That being said, however, I am keeping it on my page
for my own nostalgia and just in case anybody else is curious.

# Building and Running

If for whatever reason you'd like to see the for yourself the mess that I just described, you can run
```console
./gradlew run
```
to run the project and
```console
./gradlew shadowjar
```
to export the project to a jar file (located in app/build/libs/app-all.jar).
